- **DisMAL** (Dissonance Modeling and Analysis Library) is a library that implements various psychoacoustic models for calculating the perceived dissonance (ie, roughness & periodicity/harmonicity) of a tone or set of tones played simultaneously.
	- This enables the creation of *dissonance maps* that show how the perceived dissonance changes as the frequency intervals between the tones change.
	- These dissonance maps are a useful tool when developing tunings for a given sound spectrum, as they indicate which intervals are most consonant or dissonant.
	- The analyzed tones can have any valid [partial distribution](((629bee65-cf76-4a03-a0e9-4862024c7d4e))), enabling tunings to be constructed for inharmonic sounds that may have ones been considered "nonmusical".

- A C++ version of the library currently exists, but it doesn't include TSON support for spectrum data. A refactor that will include TSON support is #Planned for the C++ version.

- A JavaScript / TypeScript version of the library – including TSON support – is currently in progress.
