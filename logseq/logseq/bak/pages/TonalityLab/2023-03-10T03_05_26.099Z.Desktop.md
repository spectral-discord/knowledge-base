- A #Planned web app with various features for developing and archiving [tuning](((640a62ea-e616-4158-a081-aa3ff96736f8))) and [spectra](((62f2aa52-4de4-4e95-8e5a-a90fa4f99e4e))) data.
- Features will include (among others):
	- Interfaces for creating and manipulating [[TSON]] data
	- Interfaces that implement [[DisMAL]] for creating dissonance maps that can be used to construct novel tunings and spectra
	- A database for storing TSON data
	- An API for retrieving, modifying, and storing TSON data in the database
