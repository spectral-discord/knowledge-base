- (Work in progress)
	- TODO Add code contributing guidelines & tips
	- TODO Add suggestions guidelines (github issues, chat server)
	- TODO Figure out translations framework & guidelines
- **Is TSON missing something?** Do you have an idea that could make TSON more useful, interoperable, or accessible? Please leave a [github issue](https://github.com/spectral-discord/TSON/issues)!
- **Community!** I'd love for collaborators and contributors for TSON and Spectral Discord. The ideal would be for this to be a community-led project.
	- I'll be setting up a chat server soon... I'd prefer something open-source/secure like [Matrix](https://matrix.org/) or [Cwtch](https://cwtch.im/), but might succumb to Discord for accessibility.
- **Translating!** I'd like to get this Knowledge Garden translated as it becomes more stable. If you'd like to help translate it to any language, get it touch!
