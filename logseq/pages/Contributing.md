- (Work in progress)
	- TODO Add code contributing guidelines & tips
	- TODO Add suggestions guidelines (github issues, chat server)
	- TODO Figure out translations framework & guidelines
- **Is something missing?** Do you have an idea that could make these projects more useful, interoperable, or accessible? Please leave a [github issue](https://github.com/spectral-discord) or send an email to issues@spectraldiscord.com!
- **Community!** I'd love to have collaborators and contributors for any and all Spectral Discord projects. The ideal would be for this to be a community-led organization.
	- I'll be setting up a chat server at some point... I'd prefer something open-source/secure like [Matrix](https://matrix.org/), but might succumb to Discord for accessibility.
- **Translating!** I'd like to get this Knowledge Garden translated as it becomes more stable. If you'd like to help translate it to any language, get it touch!
