- #In-Progress A web app with various features for developing and archiving [tuning](((640a62ea-e616-4158-a081-aa3ff96736f8))) and [spectra](((62f2aa52-4de4-4e95-8e5a-a90fa4f99e4e))) data.
- Features will include (among others):
	- Interfaces for a variety of use cases:
		- Designing spectra whether by hand or by analyzing audio files
		- Using [[DisMAL]] models for creating dissonance maps that can be used to develop tuning systems
		- Designing tuning systems and note mappings for instruments/interfaces
		- Creating and manipulating [[TSON]] data
	- A database for storing TSON data
	- An API for running CRUD operations on TSON data, using DisMAL models, etc.
