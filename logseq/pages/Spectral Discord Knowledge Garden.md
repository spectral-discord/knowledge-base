- Welcome! This is the *work in progress* knowledge garden for Spectral Discord projects. Yay!
-
- [Spectral Discord](https://spectraldiscord.com) is a project by Lina, combining psychoacoustics research with modern audio technologies to create new tools for musical experimentation, performance, and research.
-
- The goal is to bring experimental and less-explored areas of music and sound out of academia and into the hands of artists, audio software developers, and independent researchers via free, open-source software tools.
