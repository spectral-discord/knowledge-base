- **TSONify** is a set of open-source SDKs that can be used to include TSON support in software.
	- Currently only JavaScript / TypeScript has been released, but Python, C++, and Rust are #Planned
-
- ### Check out the [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/spectral-discord/TSON)
- ### #Planned *Documentation in progress...*
- ## Features
	- TSON parsing, merging, validation, standardizing, and exporting
	- Conversion to and from existing tuning formats (.scl, .TUN)
	- Evaluating expression strings, normalizing amplitude weights, sorting notes, etc.
	- Building tunings - ie, calculating real frequency values (in Hz) for all valid notes in a tuning specification
	- Pairing spectra with tunings and scales
		- When building tunings, spectrum data can be paired and included with note data
	- #Planned An interface for the [[TonalHub]] API, for fetching and uploading TSONs, and more!
	- #Planned Spectrum interpolation â€” Morphing between two spectra across a defined frequency range
	- #Planned Variables in expressions, for dynamic tunings and spectra.
		- Predefined variables such as `rootFreq` ([root](((62919617-9d52-416c-be4f-c72edbbbda0f))) frequency, for dynamic scales and spectra that are frequency-dependent)
		- User-defined, mutable variables that can support real time morphing of tunings and spectra
