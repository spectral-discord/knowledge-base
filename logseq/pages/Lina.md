- Lina is me. I'm Lina.
	- Sometimes I do things with sounds, computers, and electronics

	- In this house, we believe:
		- Knowledge, software, and the things you need for a healthy, happy life all want to be free
		- All cops are bastards and landlords are leeches
		- Prisons, borders, and capitalism must be abolished
		- Sex / gender and race are socially-constructed systems of oppression
			- Bio-essentialism is dualistic bullshit, which is the worst kind of bullshit
		- *We can create utopias*
